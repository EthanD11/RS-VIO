# Rust Stereo Visual-Inertial Odometry (RS-VIO)

This project is a stereo visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system, written fully in Rust. It utilizes patch-based stereo feature tracking, sliding window bundle adjustment with apex-solver (Levenberg-Marquardt optimization), PnP-based motion tracking, and Rerun for 3D visualization. This first release (v0.1) only supports pure stereo odometry, IMU integration is planned for the next release.

## Features

- **Patch-based stereo feature tracking**: Multi-scale optical flow tracking using 52-point patterns for robust feature correspondence between stereo pairs.
- **Sliding window bundle adjustment**: Joint optimization of camera poses and 3D map points using apex-solver with configurable window size.
- **PnP motion tracking**: Perspective-n-Point pose estimation for inter-frame tracking between keyframes.
- **Keyframe selection**: Automatic keyframe selection based on translation and rotation thresholds.
- **Multi-camera model support**: Supports pinhole-radtan and EUCM camera models with distortion handling, more camera models can be integrated easily.
- **Dataset support**: Players for EuRoC, TUM-VI, and 4Seasons datasets with configurable parameters.
- **3D visualization**: Real-time visualization of trajectories, map points, and camera frustums using Rerun.
 
## Usage

- EuRoC:
  - Download the dataset from https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/euroc-mav/
  - Run:
```bash
cargo run --release --bin run_euroc config/euroc_vio.yaml {path_to_euroc_folder}/MH_01_easy/
```
- TUM-VI:
  - Download the 512x512 datasets in EuRoC/DSO format from https://cvg.cit.tum.de/data/datasets/visual-inertial-dataset
  - Run:
```bash
cargo run --release --bin run_tum config/tum_vi.yaml {path_to_tum_folder}/MH_01_easy/
```
- 4Seasons:
  - Download the undistorted image datasets from https://cvg.cit.tum.de/data/datasets/4seasons-dataset/download
  - Run:
```bash
cargo run --release --bin run_4seasons config/4seasons.yaml {path_to_4seasons_folder}/recording_2021-01-07_13-03-56/
```

Check the run scripts in /scripts/ for more information. Configuration files are available in the `config/` directory.

## Variable naming conventions

We use the following naming conventions for coordinate frame transformations:
- `T_B_A: Matrix4x4`: SE(3) transformation matrix from A to B
- `R_B_A: Matrix3x3`: SO(3) transformation matrix from A to B
- `t_B_A: Vector3`: translation from A to B (equal to position of origin of A in B)
- `q_B_A: UnitQuaternion`: Unit quaternion representing the rotation from A to B

Using this convention, we can easily chain transformations, e.g. `T_C_A = T_C_B * T_B_A`.



## Roadmap

This is my current plan, subject to change over time. Contributions are welcome :)

### Phase 1 - Current
- [x] Stereo patch tracking
- [x] Bundle adjustment and PnP solvers
- [x] PnP tracking for all frames
- [x] Keyframe selection method
- [x] Initial operating capability for pure stereo VO
- [x] EuRoC dataset player
- [x] TUM-VI dataset player
- [x] 4Seasons dataset player

### Phase 2 - Near future
- [ ] Small refactoring and code clean-up (coming soon)
- [ ] IMU data processing (coming soon)
- [ ] Constant velocity model* 
- [ ] Marginalization of old keyframes and keypoints**
- [ ] ROS wrapper

### Phase 3 - Extensions
- [ ] Photo- / feature-metric optimization
- [ ] Loop closure

*: This will be used mostly for rigs with bad IMUs or poorly sync'd / poorly calibrated IMUs

**: Currently, the last keyframe is fixed when solving the bundle adjustment problem. Don't expect large-scale accuracy until proper marginalization is implemented.
